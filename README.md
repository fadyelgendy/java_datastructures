# Java Datastructures
Data Structures is very imporant in sonfware engineering. Computers, of any type, heavily use Datastructure
to store, process and mainpulate data. So a good datastructre will cause a good program.

## Datastructure List:
- [x] Hashset => Hash table with unique values.
- [x] Hashmap => Hash table with (key, value) pairs internals.
- [x] Linked List => Singly Linked List
- [x] Doubly Linked List => Doubly Linked List
- [x] Stack => LIFO [last in first out] data structure
- [x] Queue => FIFO [First in first out] data structure
